Provide a common class name for each article (named locArticles)


Articles on the Library of Congress Web Site:

Frank Lloyd Wright, 1930, 1937 (Links to an external site.)

Architecture is the triumph of Human Imagination over materials,
 methods, and men, to put man into possession of his own Earth. 
It is at least the geometric pattern of things, of life, of the 
human and social world. It is at best that magic framework of reality 
that we sometimes touch upon when we use the word 'order.'

Bob Hope (Links to an external site.)

Throughout his extraordinary professional career of nearly seventy years, 
Bob Hope practiced the arts he learned in vaudeville and perpetuated variety
 entertainment traditions in stage musical comedy, motion pictures, radio, 
television, and the live appearances he made around the world in support of 
American armed forces. Today, the stage variety show is mostly a memory but 
its influence is pervasive thanks to the long and rich careers of vaudeville
 veterans like Bob Hope.-->

* For this activity only provide the code that is described below. 
You do not need to provide the other parts of the page, such as the head section,
 doctype or html tags.

Create a feedback form for your web site.
 You must use HTML 5 and  HTML 5 validation for this question.

Make sure to specify the form element with the action, method, id, name configured 
as myForm. You should not send the form values in the query string with the url, 
rather send it attached to the request. (Hint: look up methods and action!)
Configure the form element so that nothing will happen when the submit function 
is called (Hint: void)
Requirements:

The form should contain text fields and use labels. Make sure you identify which 
label works with which field!
The id and name attributes should be firstname, lastname, email, phone, 
topic, and feedback.
Make sure you indicate to the user which fields are required such as
 using an asterisk and an instruction to the user.
The user is required to enter a value for each field except comments.
The email address should be formatted as a valid email address
The phone number (USA format) as a valid phone number.
Use a regular expression with the pattern attribute for the following fields:
 email and phone.
The form should contain a field that allows the user to choose from a list of options. 
The user is required to make a selection.

What is your favorite topic on our web site?

Arts
Music
Media
History
Other
The form should contain a multi-line text box which allows the user to enter in
 multiple lines of text. The user is not required to enter a value.

There should be a submit and a reset button. When you press reset the form values
 should be reset to the default value. If you press submit, the form is submitted.
 When a person submits the form by clicking on the submit button, a javascript function 
called processFormData() is called.

After the form, insert a paragraph with the id set to results, which will be used 
to display the values when the form is processed. 3-->

<!--21
Using the feedback form you provided, display the data using JavaScript.
 You should have a paragraph which is set the id to results for that paragraph.
Show the form results in that results paragraph!

Write the JavaScript that does the following:

Make sure the fields are not empty!
Retrieve the values from each of the form fields and store them in a variable 
called results.
Make sure the results are formatted nicely with name of the field and values 
each on a separate line, as shown:
First Name:  George
Last Name:   Gunderson
Email: George@me.com
Phone: 999-999-9999
Topic: History
Feedback: Great site!
